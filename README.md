The Food Waste Reduction Platform is a Business Analysis project designed to connect restaurants, grocery stores, and bakeries with NGOs and volunteers to reduce surplus food wastage. The project focuses on solving real industry problems through structured requirement elicitation, stakeholder analysis, and clear documentation of business needs. It includes use-case modeling, process flows, user journey mapping, and functional/non-functional requirement definition to ensure the platform is efficient, transparent, and easy for all stakeholders to use.

The analysis follows Agile principles, with Epics, User Stories, acceptance criteria, and MoSCoW prioritization structured into a well-defined product backlog. Tools such as JIRA, UML, BRD, and SRS were used to plan sprints, visualize workflows, and validate requirements. The project demonstrates end-to-end BA capabilities,from understanding the problem to designing a scalable, real-world solution that improves food redistribution and reduces wastage.
